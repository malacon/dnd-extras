While wearing this ring, you can choose to summon a nocked arrow or bolt whenever you draw a bow or crossbow. The ammunition is magical and deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to any target hit by it. An arrow or bolt vanishes if you don’t fire it right away and disappears right after it hits or misses.",
